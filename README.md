# TypeTorch Studio plugin

Attaches Roblox Studio to [`typetorch serve`](https://github.com/typetorch/cli) (`tt serve`) by itself and keeps it
synced: no Connect button, no reconnecting by hand. It also lets an agent drive Studio (reconnect, play, stop, Output),
pushes code into a running playtest (kernel 0.5.4+), publishes hot assets from a panel (select a model or UI, **Add**,
then **Publish to dev**, with no place publish first), pairs with someone else's serve over the internet, and has a
**Claude** window that prompts Claude Code on the serve machine.

## Install

#### GitHub release

Download `TypeTorchSync.rbxm` from the [latest release](https://github.com/typetorch/studio-plugin/releases/latest)
into Studio's plugins folder (Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\Plugins`, macOS: `~/Documents/Roblox/Plugins`), then
restart Studio (or reload plugins). Releases are the main channel: every version lands there first.

#### Creator Store

The plugin is also on the [Creator Store](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/135066807179101/TypeTorch). That copy is
updated by hand (see Releasing), so it can lag behind the latest GitHub release.

#### From a checkout

`rojo build default.project.json --plugin TypeTorchSync.rbxm` (`npm run install-plugin`; `npm run build` writes
`TypeTorchSync.rbxm` to the repo instead), or `tt studio install-plugin --from <this folder>`. The plugin is not on
npm.

Then run `tt serve` in the game folder: the plugin finds it. The CLI's README ("Studio: typetorch serve") describes the
whole loop.

## The panel

The toolbar's **TypeTorch** button opens the dock widget (its icon follows the connection state once the icon ids in
`Icons.luau` are set). Cards, top to bottom:

- **Status**: waiting, connecting, synced, disconnected (retrying) or paused; the attached project and its ports, the
  last sync. **Reconnect** starts over (a full resync); **Auto-connect: on/off** (per place); **Connect anyway** shows
  when the only serve found is for another experience.
- **Remote server**: pair with someone else's serve (below), and **Use local serve** to go back.
- **Playtest**: **Live playtest: on/off**. On, the playtest's server syncs code into the running game and the kernel
  (0.5.4+) reloads on changes, with no Stop + Play.
- **Hot assets**: the hot assets marked in the place and what the last check found. **Add** marks the Explorer
  selection (the name box sets the key; with one hot asset selected, a new name turns Add into **Rename**), **Remove**
  unmarks it. **Check** compares the place with the lockfile, **Upload** uploads new and changed assets, **Publish to
  dev** (named after the lockfile's dev branch) uploads and deploys them to that branch. Each button shows only when it
  has work; they send the open place's export to serve as a job.
- **Compile**: the last compile result and its first errors.
- **typetorch serve**: serve's child processes and their restarts.

In Play the toolbar and windows stay (on the client in Play, the server in Run); a playtest's panel shows only status,
playtest and compile, since pairing and hot assets act on the edit session.

## Releasing

`npm version <x.y.z> -m "release %s" && git push origin main --follow-tags`, after setting `VERSION` in
`src/TypeTorch/App.luau` (the version the panel shows) to the same number. The tag runs
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (nothing else does: no PR or branch runs): it checks the tag against `package.json`,
builds `TypeTorchSync.rbxm` with the Rojo that `rokit.toml` pins, and publishes the GitHub release with the rbxm
attached (a version with `-`, like `-rc.1`, is a prerelease).

For a stable version the `roblox` job then tries to update the Creator Store asset through Open Cloud
(`.github/scripts/roblox-upload.sh`): the rbxm, then the description (`.github/store-description.txt` plus the version,
the date and the commits since the previous tag). It reads only the GitHub environment `roblox`: secret
`ROBLOX_API_KEY` (an Open Cloud key with the **Assets** API, Read + Write, owned by the asset's creator), variable
`ROBLOX_PLUGIN_ASSET_ID`. Without them it skips with a notice.

Open Cloud doesn't take Plugin assets from API keys yet ("TargetType Plugin is not supported yet"), so today that job
only warns, writes the manual steps to the run summary and stays green. **Publishing to Roblox is manual**: download the
release's `TypeTorchSync.rbxm`, drag it into a place in Studio, right-click it in the Explorer, **Publish as Plugin**,
and overwrite the existing asset (135066807179101). The job starts uploading by itself once Roblox supports it.

## Working with someone else's serve

The owner runs `tt serve --remote`. serve opens a gateway on `localhost:34890` and a free Cloudflare quick tunnel to
it (cloudflared is installed when missing), then prints a one-time pairing link: the tunnel URL with the code after a
`#`, like `https://<name>.trycloudflare.com#<code>`, valid 15 minutes (`tt serve status` shows it again, `tt serve
pair` makes a new one; with `--url <tunnel>` or `--no-tunnel` the owner uses their own tunnel and `tt serve pair
--url`).

Paste the whole link into the panel's **Remote server** card and press **Pair** (or Enter). The plugin splits it on the
last `#`, sends the code with your Roblox user id and name to `<url>/tt/pair`, and keeps the device token it gets back
in its settings; a bare code without a URL pairs with a `serve --remote` on this machine (`http://localhost:34890`).
Studio then syncs from that serve (code read-only, Rojo at `<url>/r/<token>`) and the Hot assets buttons run there.
The pairing lasts 30 days on the owner's side (`tt serve devices`, `tt serve unpair`). **Use local serve** goes back to
the local serve (the pairing stays valid until the owner unpairs it). See the CLI's README ("A Studio on another
machine").

## Claude

The toolbar's **Claude** button opens a chat with Claude Code on the machine that runs `tt serve --claude`
(remote-claude from `@typetorch/dev-server`), a port of the in-game DEV > Claude tab. It works with a local serve and
with a paired remote one, through serve's `/tt/claude/...` routes; replies stream over serve's WebSocket
(`/tt/claude/stream`), with HTTP polling while there is no stream. Only allowed Roblox users can prompt: serve's
`--claude-users <ids>`, by default the owners in `typetorch.json`. A remote Studio prompts as the user it paired with,
so the owner adds a helper's id there (pair again after updating the plugin, so serve knows your user). Each dev has
their own worktree on the serve machine, so several devs can use it at once.

- **Code mode from Studio**: Claude edits a copy of the serve machine's branch. The Live / Code pill shows the mode;
  Live (game tools on a running server) works from the in-game tab.
- **The open place**: Claude can read it (`inspect`, `find`, Studio output, status) and change it with Luau snippets
  that run in this Studio's Edit DataModel at once, each one undo step (Ctrl+Z); the code shows in the chat. Only
  prompts sent from this chat are answered (`src/TypeTorch/StudioTools.luau`). Save or publish the place to keep the
  changes.
- **"+" menu** for the next message: **Dex path** (the Studio selection), **My logs** (this DataModel's Output),
  **Server logs** and **Screenshot** (in Play only), **Toolbox** (Creator Store tools for that message only).
- **New chat**; tap the status line for recent chats; the copy icon on a reply selects its Markdown for Ctrl+C. Images
  Claude shows are drawn in the chat. The chat is kept on serve per user, so it follows you between Edit and Play.
- **Apply this change?** When a run changed files, remote-claude commits them and the reply ends in a card with the
  summary and the changed files (+/- lines):
  - **Apply** (green) puts the change into the checkout serve's Rojo syncs to Studio, uncommitted, so you review and
    commit it there. A change to lines that changed there too is refused and the checkout is left as it was.
  - **Deploy to dev** runs `typetorch deploy` of that commit to the dev branch; the card shows "Deploying...",
    "Waiting for approval on your PC" when the deploy needs the owner's approval, then "Deployed" with the build id
    (or why it failed). Running dev servers hot-swap to it.
  - **Discard** drops the commit.
  - With no answer in 15 minutes the change is discarded. Only the user who sent the prompt can decide. A card whose
    change was lost to a restart of serve or remote-claude says so.

## Layout

The control API's contract is `src/serve/protocol.ts` in typetorch/cli; the two must change together.

- `src/Main.server.luau`: the plugin script.
- `src/TypeTorch/App.luau`: finds the server (`GET /tt/hello` on 34880-34887, one port at a time so Studio asks for HTTP
  permission only for ports a serve uses: `Control.discover`), picks the one whose universeId matches
  the place, runs Rojo's sync, reconnects, reports to the server. In a playtest's server it syncs into the running game
  and sets `ServerStorage.TypeTorchDev`'s `LiveReload` attribute, which makes the kernel (0.5.4+) reload on changes.
- `src/TypeTorch/Agent.luau`: in every DataModel (edit, playtest server and client): runs the commands an agent sends
  through `typetorch studio` / `typetorch mcp` (long poll on `/tt/plugin/poll`), forwards Studio's Output, and in edit
  mode reconnects when the `TypeTorchReconnect` attribute is set on ServerStorage.
- `src/TypeTorch/Assets.luau`: hot assets in the place (add, remove, the sync's rules) and their export from the open
  place (`SerializationService`, the same format as the CLI's export task); the panel's Check / Upload / Publish to dev
  buttons send that export to `typetorch serve` as a job (`POST /tt/jobs`, `assets status|sync --studio-export`).
  While the panel is open and a serve is attached, the check also runs by itself every 30 s (never while a job runs,
  never with nothing marked): the export is made and compared with the last check's, and only a changed place or
  lockfile reaches serve. A check's answer (CLI 0.12.2+) carries a diff per new, changed or removed asset:
  `Assets.describeDiff` turns it into the lines behind each row's **Diff** button (instances added, removed, changed
  with old and new property values; an older serve sends none and the button stays hidden).
- `src/TypeTorch/Icons.luau`: the toolbar icons as `rbxassetid://<id>`: the TypeTorch button's per connection state
  (gray waiting, amber connecting, green synced, red disconnected) and the Claude button's. Their PNGs are in
  `assets/icons/`; `bun scripts/upload-icons.ts --user <id> [--env-file <game repo>/.env]` (or `--group <id>`) uploads
  them as Images with an Open Cloud assets key and fills the ids in. An empty id keeps Studio's default icon.
- `src/TypeTorch/Panel.luau`, `Widgets.luau`: the dock widget, in the TypeTorch dev menu's look.
- `src/TypeTorch/Claude.luau`: the Claude window (`/tt/claude/...` on serve, which talks to remote-claude).
- `src/TypeTorch/StudioTools.luau`: Claude's game tools on the open place, for prompts from this chat (Edit only).
- `src/TypeTorch/Control.luau`: the control API client (cli `src/serve/protocol.ts` is the contract): a local port, or
  a paired remote serve (its URL plus a device token; Rojo at `<url>/r/<token>`).
- `vendor/rojo/`: Rojo's plugin core, unchanged except where marked.
- `assets/toolbar-icon.png` (32 px) and `toolbar-icon@2x.png` (64 px): the TypeTorch logo for the toolbar button. Upload
  the 32 px one as an image asset and put its `rbxassetid://` in `TOOLBAR_ICON` (`Panel.luau`). The logo's source is
  `brand/` in typetorch/docs.

## Rojo (vendored, MPL-2.0)

`vendor/rojo/` is the plugin core of [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) **7.7.0-rc.1** (the version
`rokit.toml` pins in TypeTorch games), so it speaks the same protocol as `rojo serve`: `plugin/src` without the
Roact UI (`App/`), assets, sounds, tests and its entry script, plus its packages `http`, `log`, `fmt`, `rbx_dom_lua`
(without `allValues.json`, used only by tests), Promise and t. Those files are under the Mozilla Public License 2.0
(`vendor/rojo/LICENSE.txt`); Promise and t keep their own licenses next to them.

Changed files (MPL-2.0 still applies to them, and each says what changed at its top):

- `Plugin/Settings.lua`: no Roact (`getBinding`/`getBindings` removed); settings are stored as `TypeTorchRojo_<name>`
  so they never mix with the stock Rojo plugin's.

To update Rojo: copy the same files from the new tag, re-apply the change above, and keep `Version.txt` in step with
the `rojo` that `rokit.toml` pins.

## License

MIT (`LICENSE`), except `vendor/rojo/` (MPL-2.0, see above).
